      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I was born in Iowa, and have lived in the Kansas City metro area since 1999. I am married to the ever-supportive Nancy, and together we have four children, the oldest of which just graduated from high school!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I mostly grew up on a farm just south of Des Moines. The rural school district I attended was named after I-35, so naturally our mascot was the super-intimidating roadrunner.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy watching movies of all kinds, especially sci-fi. I also spend a lot of time listening to podcasts and audio books. I ran my first half-marathon in October and discovered a fondness for running in the process.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I honestly don't know! I'd like to think that there are lots of different jobs that could challenge my problem-solving skills and give me opportunities to be creative.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I've lived in same house in Lenexa since we moved here in 1999. Since then, we're filled the house with four fantastic kids!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In short, I want make stuff that solves problems â€” stuff that I can point to afterward and say, "I did that." I also like the limitless opportunity that exists in web development.</p>
